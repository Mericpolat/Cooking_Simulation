# Cooking Simulation Project

This project simulates various cooking processes including heat transfer, Maillard reaction, protein denaturation, and more.
Each module corresponds to a specific physical or chemical process in cooking.

```

## How to Run the Project

1. Install required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the main simulation script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. View the results in the `outputs/` directory.

## Modules

Each process in cooking is modeled in Python:
1. Heat and moisture transfer
2. Maillard reaction and caramelization
3. Texture changes (softening and hardening)
4. Aroma evaporation
5. Protein denaturation
6. Water activity changes
7. Phase transitions
8. Nutrient loss
9. Fat distribution and melting
10. Mass transfer (salt/spice diffusion)
11. Temperature convection
12. Chemical reactions
13. Energy transfer
